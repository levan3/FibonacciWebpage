    <h3>What is the Fibonacci sequence?</h3>
    <p>The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers that follow a certain rule: each term of the sequence is equal to the sum of two preceding terms. This way, each term can be expressed by this equation:
        <br>
        <br>  
        Fₙ = Fₙ₋₂ + Fₙ₋₁
        <br>
        <br>
        The Fibonacci sequence typically has first two terms equal to F₀ = 0 and F₁ = 1. Alternatively, you can choose F₁ = 1 and F₂ = 1 as the sequence starters. Unlike in an arithmetic sequence, you need to know at least two consecutive terms to figure out the rest of the sequence.
        <br>
        <br>
        The Fibonacci sequence rule is also valid for negative terms - for example, you can find F₋₁ to be equal to 1.

        The first fifteen terms of the Fibonacci sequence are: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377...</p>
